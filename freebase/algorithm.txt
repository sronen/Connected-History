as long as i < len(search_set):
	pick guid no. i from search_set
	query connections and person properties for guid
	write person properties to node table
	store all connected_guids in connected_guid_list
	for connected_guid in connected_guid_list:
		write connection properties to edge table #### even if already connected through a different type
		if connected_guid not in search_set:
	 		add connected_guid to search_set
	increment i
	flush connected_guid_list

### Notes:
1. Multiple connections between nodes are allowed. Each connection is written in a separate line, so it's easier to distinguish properties.
2. The connected_guid_list is flushed upon seed switch (whenever i is incremented)
3. Search_set, as the name implies, doesn't not allow duplicates -- they're not necessary
